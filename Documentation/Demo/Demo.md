# Welcome to the app demo
This document is used to showcase the various features of this app as its actual functionality will not be available after the Fall 2024 semester. This is due to the fact that our app ran with various AWS integrations and we needed to remove all resources to keep our costs down. As such, we have provided this document as a stand-in. We hope you enjoy!

## Feature 1 - Profile Management
This is a pretty standard feature, and isn't very interesting, but is still showcased here to show what we have done! It should be worth noting that Cognito made it difficult to modify how the UI looked, and as such, we have decided to use the built-in web sign-in page.

## Feature 2 - Friendship
This feature was originally a part of the profile management feature, but due to the work required to implement this, we have deemed it worthy of its own demo.
